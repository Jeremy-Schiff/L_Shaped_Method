# L_Shaped_Method
MATLAB implementation of the L Shaped Method for two stage linear programming problems.
Developed as part of Tufts COMP 150 - Advanced Algorithms. I noticed that no other implementation is available, so figured I would share
my work even though it likely remains a tad rough. Time permitting I can polish this on par with JMEP so it is commercially viable.
